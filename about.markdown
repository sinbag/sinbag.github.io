From last 10 years or so, I have spent most of my time developing mathematical models to understand the role of randomness. 
I am fascinated by noise. Currently, I am investigating how noise plays a pivotal role in generative AI models. Before that, I spent a decade understanding how noise impacts the convergence behaviour of various rendering systems (for physically based light transport).

Myself Gurpreet, I come from a small town Jalandhar in Punjab, India. 
I did my schooling from Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 2, Jalandhar. I got into IIT Delhi and from there my journey started. 

At the core of my research, I develop Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling strategies for high-dimensional numerical integration problems. 
My research is published at the top-tier conferences (SIGGRAPH / SIGGRAPH Asia / ECCV / NeurIPS).
I am equally interested in applying Monte Carlo, Quasi-Monte Carlo and MCMC sampling strategies in other domains.
